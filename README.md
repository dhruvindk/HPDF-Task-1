What is React?
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Information:
This is built with npm (Node Package Manager) as it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; and it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. So download Node.js first. It is also built using components from material-ui. 

How to use?
To run this on your system download the zip folder and extract all files. There are 2 folders one for search page and one for home page. Navigate to one of them in your command line and run "npm install" this should take care of all required dependencies and node modules, then run "npm start" and you should see the page up and running in your default browser.

Conclusion of using ReactJs:
-easy to know how a component is rendered, we just look at the render function.
-JSX makes it easy to read the code of your components. It is also really easy to see the layout, or how components are plugged/combined    with each other.
-we can render React on the server-side.
-it is easy to test, and you can also integrate some tools like jest.
-it ensures readability and makes maintainability easier.
-we can use React with any framework (Backbone.js, Angular.js) as it is only a view layer.
